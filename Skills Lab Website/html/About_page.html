      <article><p>I Would like to introduce myself: My name is Kasparas Litinskas, and i come from Vilnius, Lithuania
      (country in the Baltics). 21 years old, and studying in Netherlands. This is my first website, that i have made
    myself(With some help, of course). I finished school at the age of 19, and after that, i started working in
    a technology distibution company, called TD Baltic. In there i worked as Product Information specialist, so i learned
    more about the products, and how to manage a internet shop style website</p></article>
